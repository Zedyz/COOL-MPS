# TODO

- Fix issues with SELF_TYPE vs. Object.
- Fix substring (likely a structure issue).
- Class diagrams should be in vector format (such as SVG)
- The name of the Main class should use a checking rule instead of a constraint on the name itself.
- Using the comma key may not be the best interaction method.
  The dispatch option should be directly in the context menu.

  Keyword constraints can be added to this concept instead of individual concepts. 
- Fix errors
- Fix equality of strings
- Add possibility for comments
- Add possibility for empty lines
